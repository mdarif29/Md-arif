here is a step-by-step algorithm for performing a binary search:

Input:

A sorted array arr of size n.
A target element x that we want to search for in the array.
Output:

The index of the target element in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
Step 1: Initialize variables

Let low be 0, which will represent the lower bound of the search interval.
Let high be n-1, which will represent the upper bound of the search interval.
Let mid be (low + high) / 2, which will represent the middle index of the search interval.
Step 2: Compare the target element with the element at the middle index

If arr[mid] is equal to x, then the target element has been found, and the search can stop. Return the index mid as the result.
Otherwise, if arr[mid] is less than x, then the target element must be in the lower half of the search interval, so set high to mid-1 and repeat the comparison.
Otherwise, if arr[mid] is greater than x, then the target element must be in the upper half of the search interval, so set low to mid+1 and repeat the comparison.
Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the target element is found or the search interval is empty

Continue repeating steps 1 and 2 until the target element is found or the search interval is empty (i.e., low > high).
If the search interval becomes empty before the target element is found, then the element is not present in the array, and the search can return -1 as the result.
Example of how the binary search algorithm works:

Suppose we have the following sorted array:
arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
And suppose we want to search for the element 23 in the array. Here's how the binary search algorithm would work:

Step 1: Initialize variables

low = 0
high = 9
mid = 4
Step 2: Compare the target element with the element at the middle index

arr[mid] = 16
Since arr[mid] is greater than the target element 23, set low to mid+1 = 5 and repeat the comparison.
Step 2 (again): Compare the target element with the element at the middle index

arr[mid] = 23
Since arr[mid] is equal to the target element, the search can stop. Return the index mid = 5 as the result.
The final result is that the element 23 is found at index 5 in the array.

Time complexity analysis:
Each iteration of the binary search algorithm reduces the size of the search interval by half, so the number of iterations required to find the target element is logarithmic in the size of the array. 
Specifically, the time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the size of the array.

//WAP OF BINARY SEARCH 
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func binarySearch(arr []int, x int) int {
	low := 0
	high := len(arr) - 1
	var mid int

	for low <= high {
		mid = (high + low) / 2

		if arr[mid] < x {
			low = mid + 1
		} else if arr[mid] > x {
			high = mid - 1
		} else {
			return mid
		}
	}

	return -1
}
This Go program defines a binarySearch function that takes a sorted array arr and an integer x as inputs. It returns the index of x in arr if x is present, otherwise, it returns -1.

//In the main function, the program tests the binarySearch function by performing a binary search for the integer 10 in the array [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]. If the element is found, the program prints the element's index; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the element is not present in the array.

func main() {
	arr := []int{2, 3, 4, 10, 40}
	x := 10

	result := binarySearch(arr, x)
	if result != -1 {
		fmt.Printf("Element is present at index %d", result)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Element is not present in array")
	}
}
